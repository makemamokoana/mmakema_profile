            Outside my professional career I <br> invest time in developing <br> leadership and entrepreneurial skills.
             I <br>aspire to become a community <br> builder, someone who works and <br> gives back to her people. <br><br>

             I want my work to inspire a generation <br>of innovative thinkers, people who <br>think
             outside their gender and <br>socioeconomic boundaries.

            It is my belief that keeping a healthy body and mind<br>
            is of a great value. I invest time in maintaining a healthy work/life balance <br>
            to remain at the top of my game. That is why i go to gym and jog. To keep<br>
            a healthy and elastic mind I read informative books and blogs, <br>
            keep up with whats happening around me and in the world.<br>
            That is kee to remaining healthy in all ways. </p>
